Hi all! My name is Amy, I am a Colorado native, and currently live about twenty minutes north of Denver. My husband and I have four girls ranging in age from eighteen to twenty-seven. We enjoy playing board games, watching movies, and going camping. A couple interesting facts about me; I have had the opportunity to go to Belize and setup computer labs in small villages that didnâ€™t have internet or electricity and teach young children how to use a computer, an experience that is truly one of the best of my life. Another interesting thing about me is that I recently got my motorcycle license. My husband and I completed Pathways last year and decided that since all our children were either at college or married, that we would work on our education as well. I am working on finishing my degree, and my husband is working on completing his as well.
